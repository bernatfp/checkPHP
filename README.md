CheckPHP
=====

This script does a quick syntax check on your PHP project

How to use it
-------------

### Usage

First place the script in the root path of your project.

Just type this in your terminal:

	./checkphp.sh

If you are working with MAMP and it's on its default path `/Applications/MAMP/` you can also display the PHP error log this way:
	
	./checkphp.sh -l

### Limitations

Linux users must have `php5-cli` installed.
